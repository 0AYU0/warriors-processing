Second time was against the Bulls, he left the game and then sat against the Knicks. Then, three games later, he injures it again tonight. While I realize some of these were situational injuries and not directly caused (like coming down on someone's foot against the Bulls), the organization needs to proceed with caution from here on out if they want Curry to remain healthy. Furthermore, we don't Curry's ankle to become a Brandon Roy-type knee problem.. the kind that haunt and ultimately kill a young and prosperous career.\n\nPersonally, I think Curry needs to sit about 10 games to make sure this ankle is really ready to go for this season. Strengthen it, ice it, rest it, do whatever you can for it. I would rather see him out for X amount of games healing his ankle early this season than see his whole season or career go to waste by continuing to strain it.\n\nThoughts?", "meta": {"score": 3, "top_level_comment": null, "retrieved_on": -1, "gilded": -1, "gildings": null, "subreddit": "warriors", "stickied": false, "permalink": "/r/warriors/comments/o3kms/will_curry_ever_be_the_same_again/", "author_flair_text": ""}}
